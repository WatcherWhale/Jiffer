# ICT-Architecture

This was a project for the course 'ICT-Architecture'. We were tasked with
creating a high available application using the AWS services.

## Description

Jiffer is a image hosting website that serves and creates GIF's or as they are
meant to be called 'Jiffs'. Jiffs are created from a series of images and then
converted with user defined filters to a Jiff. These Jiffs were then hosted on
the website for at least 24 hours before automatically being deleted.  As an
exception there are also featured Jiffs these were hosted for at least 30 days
before being deleted.

The requirements for the project were:
- Using an EC2 instance
- Using a RDS database
